1. What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool? 
- Compatibility with the Processes of Your Organization: Make sure the tool complies with the criteria engineering procedures and techniques used by your company. Your unique method for obtaining, recording, and organizing requirements should be supported by it.
- Ease of Use: The tool should be simple to use and shouldn't add extra layers of complexity to the requirements engineering procedure. If a tool is too complicated to use, the project team may become resistant to use.
- Cooperation and Communication: Seek for resources that facilitate stakeholder collaboration. In addition to allowing for traceability and version control, they should facilitate real-time communication, feedback, and requirement discussion.
- Customization: It's crucial to have the option to tailor the tool to your own requirements. Specific fields, templates, and procedures for handling requirements may be needed for various projects and sectors.
- Traceability: Throughout the whole development process, requirements should be able to be tracked down using a competent requirements engineering tool. This makes it easier to guarantee that all standards are met and that modifications are monitored.

2. Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?
- Complexity: A considerable learning curve may be necessary for users of certain requirements engineering tools due to their complexity. This can lead to resistance among team members who find the tool difficult to use or time-consuming.
- Over-Engineering: Tools with a variety of features and customization choices may lure users to over-engineer the requirements documents, resulting in unnecessary depth and complexity.
- Loss of Human Interaction: Relying too much on technologies might prevent team members and stakeholders from communicating directly or in person, which could result in miscommunication or the omission of important details in the requirements.
- Lack of Flexibility: Some solutions could not be adaptable enough to handle special or changing requirements procedures, which could result in a rigid strategy that isn't align with your organization's specific needs.
- Maintenance and Updates: It might take a lot of work to keep the tool updated with the newest patches, versions, and updates. Failure to maintain the tool can lead to security vulnerabilities and loss of support.
- Integration Difficulties: It might be difficult to integrate the requirements engineering tool with other tools and systems in your development environment. There might be incompatibilities, in which case further work would be needed to accomplish a smooth integration.
- Version Control: In certain circumstances, maintaining requirements and modifications in a tool may be more difficult than utilizing version control systems. This can lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the requirements.

3. When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?
- Check the open-source tool's community of users and developers to see if they are active and involved. Bug fixes, feature additions, and continuous support may be obtained from a thriving community.
- Evaluation of the tool's maturity and stability is necessary. Open-source projects that are well-established and have a track record of consistent releases are often more trustworthy.
- Seek for a tool that may be tailored to your unique requirements and engineering procedures. It is essential to be able to customize the tool to meet your demands.
- Sufficient documentation is necessary for successful adoption and support. This includes user manuals, installation guidelines, and developer documentation.

4. How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?
- Tools can play a significant role in enabling distributed, global requirements engineering activities by providing the necessary infrastructure and features to facilitate collaboration and communication among stakeholders in different geographic locations. However, there are also drawbacks and challenges associated with distributed requirements engineering. Here's how tools can enable such activities and some common drawbacks:
- Advantages
    + Real-time Collaboration: Regardless of their location, team members and stakeholders may work on requirements concurrently thanks to tools that facilitate real-time collaboration. This encourages remote teams to work together.
    + Centralized Repository: A central location for requirements documentation is made available by tools. To guarantee that everyone is working with the most recent information, team members may access, evaluate, and edit requirements from any location.
    + Version Control: Teams may monitor needs changes over time by using tools with version control features. This is necessary to maintain traceability and manage changing requirements.
    + Traceability: Test cases, specifications, and user stories are examples of requirements artifacts that may be traced back to one another with the use of requirements engineering tools. This traceability facilitates comprehension of how changes affect dispersed teams.
- Disadvantages:
    + Communication Challenges: Although tools provide communication features, they cannot fully replace face-to-face communication, which can be more effective in conveying nuances and resolving misunderstandings.
    + Collaboration Barriers: It is possible for team members in various time zones to have limited opportunities for overlap in their working hours, which can cause delays in communication and decision-making.
    + Language and cultural barriers may affect how requirements are understood and interpreted, which might result in misunderstandings and misalignment.
    + Technical Challenges: Tools may have technical limitations, such as slow performance, which can hinder productivity, especially when working with large datasets.
